## Background and Business Question
There have been recent changes to the Baltimore City employee compensation plan, most notably an increase in base pay to $250,000 plus moving expenses for [City Adminstrator Christopher Shorter](https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-ci-city-administrator-salary-20201223-ylkd3up7bfgrrcl56p7lcqafwm-story.html). This makes him one of the highest base salary earners in the City government, however it was noted that other City employees, who recieved equal to or less than this base salary, earned higher gross pay. This discrepancy begs the question, how might different job titles within Baltimore City government be clustered based on their gross and annual pay? Given the difference in gross and annual pay mentioned in recent news, this quesiton is worthy to examine to determine potential gorupings of job titles based on annual salary and gross pay and to see what trends exsit between groups, if any. 
## Data Sources and Analytics
A cluster analysis was performed for [Baltimore City Employee Salary Data](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/browse?category=City+Government) in which four clusters were identified based on an initial scatterplot which showed annual salary vs gross pay. The two variables were spread throughout the graph and could be identified in four different quadrants, so four clusters were chosen for this analysis. The two variables examined were gross pay and annual pay and the cluster analysis calculated optimal anchor values. The amount of job titles within each cluster were also identified to understand the extent to which each cluster grouped job titles. This dataset included over 150,000 data points with different job titles so only the amount of jobs in each cluster were calculated, rather than individual titles in each cluster as this would've been impractical to view given the spread of the data and breadth of each cluster.

The final cluster analysis was used to determine the amount of job titles within each cluster, which indicate how jobs are spread between gross pay and annual salary. Graph 2 shows the findings of each cluster, most notably that Cluster 4 has 0 job titles. Cluster 4 reflected a below average annual salary and below average gross pay combination. This signifies that no job titles reflect this relationship and all fall under the first three clusters.

The anchor nodes were also analyzed and their characteristics were summarized in Table 1. The table reflects the anchor node chosen and the characteristics of each anchor node after performing the cluster analysis and having the optimal anchor nodes chosen to minimize the squared distance between data points and the anchor node. The interpretations of the standardized annual pay and gross salary for each anchor node are indicated in the table with a corresponding key to understand what each value means.
